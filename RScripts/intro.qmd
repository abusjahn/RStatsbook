# Introduction

Chapters will follow my usual schedule, starting from R basics, introducing ggplot, data import, data preparation and cleaning, descriptive statistics, simple test statistics, then progression to linear models (regression/ANOVA), generalized linear models with logistic regression as example, linear mixed effect models, and machine learning.

But first things first, installation of necessary and useful tools and setup of our environment.

## Installation of R

[The Comprehensive R Archive Network (r-project.org)](https://cran.r-project.org/)

If using Windows, install Rtools as well (3 GB)

If on linux, R2U is useful:

[CRAN as Ubuntu Binaries - r2u (eddelbuettel.github.io)](https://eddelbuettel.github.io/r2u/)

## Installation of RStudio Desktop (UI)

[RStudio Desktop - Posit](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

## Installation of Quarto (Reportgenerator)

[Quarto - Get Started](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)

## Installation of git:

[Git - Downloads (git-scm.com)](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Setup RStudio

There are many options available to adjust the UI to your liking, some default settings should be changed. There are global and project specific options, both can be found under Menu /Tools. Some useful (IMHO) changes are highlighted:

There are MANY more settings to adjust RStudios appearance and behavior to your liking.

## Projects on your computer

It is terribly important (or at least helpful) to be organized ! Different analyses for e.g. new experiments or new data sets should be separated, demo analyses and exercises as well. Project structures should be consistent to make re-use of scripts easier.

As a starting point, I suggest creating a folder for everything R-related, e.g. ***Rstuff***

### Option 1: Create manually

-   Define location for project folder (often somewhere under C:/Users/SomeName/Documents),\
    for seminar projects this should be the folder you just created, Rstuff or whatever name you used.

-   In that folder, create a new folder, e.g. Rexercises

-   Create useful sub-folders, I recommend /RScripts and /Data as minimal structure; be consistent in naming!!

You should have a folder structure something like this:

-   Rstuff

    -   Rexercises

        -   RScripts

        -   Data

    -   SomeProject

        -   RScripts

        -   Data

Now you are ready to create a project in RStudio:

![](/Graphs/project1.png)

As there is an existing directory, this is what you select.

![](/Graphs/project2.png)

In this new window you browse to the root folder of your project and create your project. Tgis will create new (possibly hidden) entries:

![](/Graphs/projectfolder.png)

### Option 2: Create from a github repository

e.g.Â  https://github.com/abusjahn/RStatsbook

Here you have to define source and new location.
