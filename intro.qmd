# Introduction

There are plenty of books available, check out e.g.

[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/ "R for Data Science"){target="_blank"}

[Modern Statistics for Modern Biology](https://www.huber.embl.de/msmb/){target="_blank"}

[Modern R with the tidyverse](http://modern-rstats.eu/){target="_blank"}

[ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](https://ggplot2-book.org/){target="_blank"}

Chapters will follow my usual schedule, starting from R basics, introducing ggplot, data import, data preparation and cleaning, descriptive statistics, simple test statistics, then progression to linear models (regression/ANOVA), generalized linear models with logistic regression as example, linear mixed effect models, and machine learning.
