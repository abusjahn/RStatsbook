# Machine Learning with R: Basic concepts

## structured vs. unstructured data

## supervised vs. unsupervised methods

## Resampling methods

-   Creation of new samples based on one observed sample.

-   Helps in creating new synthetic datasets for training machine learning models and to estimate properties of a dataset when the dataset is unknown, difficult to estimate, or when the sample size of the dataset is small.

-   Resampling Methods

    -   Permutation tests (also re-randomization tests)

    -   Bootstrapping

    -   Jackknife (Leave one out validation)

    -   Cross validation

### Permutation tests

-   Permutation reshuffles the observed cases, sampling without replacement, e.g. Random combination of 2 classes (like disease / risk)

-   Original:

| Class 1  | Class 2 |
|----------|---------|
| Affected | Exposed |
| Affected | Exposed |
| Affected | \-      |
| Control  | \-      |
| Control  | \-      |

-   Permutation 1

| Class 1  | Class 2 |
|----------|---------|
| Affected | \-      |
| Affected | Exposed |
| Affected | \-      |
| Control  | \-      |
| Control  | Exposed |

-   repeated x times

### Bootstrapping

-   Bootstrapping selects from the population of observed cases, sampling with replacement.

-   Bootstrap is a powerful statistical tool used to quantify the uncertainty of a given model.

### Jacknife

-   Jackknife is resampling without replacement

-   Creates n samples of size n-1

### k-fold CV

-   Splitting sample into k groups

-   One group for testing,

-   k-1 groups for training

-   Repeated k times, no resampling
